    "details": "Computer programming can be defined as the set of processes involved in designing and developing an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific task through computers. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, algorithm generation, profiling algorithms' accuracy, and implementing the algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).\n\nIn other words, programming can be understood as the sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task on a computer. In general, the purpose of programming is to solve a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic."
